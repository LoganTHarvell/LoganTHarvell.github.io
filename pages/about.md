## About Me

Hello world, or otherwise curious voyeur! My name is Logan Harvell, and this site collects my musings and tinkerings as a developer.

Before getting into more technical discussion, I would like to talk a bit about myself. I hail from a small city named Orlando located somewhere around the middle of the lovely sunshine state, Florida. So, naturally, I spend many of my days hiding from the sun in front of a screen. I am a lover of science fiction and fantasy, video games, movies, anime, graphic novels, and most things from the 90's.

Chances are, if you ask me about something relevant to nerd/geek culture, then I will have something to talk to you about and we might have already become friends. However, while I joke about my stints as a cave dweller, as an Eagle Scout, I feel obligated to mention my *other* love of the outdoors. Scandalous! I know. I spent much of my youth going camping, hiking, even scuba diving, and experiencing all the beauty nature has to offer.

As a programmer, I dabbled with basic bash scripting on a command line growing up, but it wasn't until 2015 that I began to dive into programming. It truly started with an introduction to C programming course at the *University of Central Florida* (UCF). Fast forward to December 2018 and I graduated from the university with honors and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Somewhere in the middle, I developed a strong foundation for algorithm design and analysis, object-oriented design, C/C++ programming, and 3D math. I also gained experience in a variety of topics including computer architecture, graphics, and vision.

After graduating in December 2018, I spent over half a year as a research assistant at UCF's *Institute for Simulation and Training* (IST) under Dr. Joseph Kider. During my time at IST, I collaborated on an Air Force contract, developing plugin tools for Unreal Engine 4. By Fall 2019, I began pursuing a master's degree in Interactive Entertainment at UCF's *Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy* (FIEA), a top ranked graduate program for games development.

At FIEA, I worked on several different small teams to create two week game prototypes, programmed games in from scratch in 68K assembly and C/C++, as well as in Unity and Unreal Engine 4 using C# and C++ respectively. I also developed a [custom data-driven game engine](/fiea-game-engine) from scratch. Since December 2019, I've been the lead programmer on Keepers of the Trees at Studio Chili, a studio formed with 20+ artists, designers, and programmers. [Keepers of the Trees](/keepers-of-the-trees) is a local co-op puzzle platformer created in Unreal Engine 4, aiming for release on for release on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356800/Keepers_of_the_Trees/?curator_clanid=4777282&utm_source=SteamDB) August 7th, 2020.

Since August 2020, I have interned, full-time, as an Engine Programmer on the Special Projects team at Epic Games. My role includes supporting projects and designers by creating UI and gameplay systems using C++ and Unreal Engine blueprints, as well as integrating, testing, and debugging new engine features from Unreal Engine 5.

I anticipate my graduation from FIEA in December 2020. Post-graduation, I will be pursuing full-time Engine Programmer roles in games development.
