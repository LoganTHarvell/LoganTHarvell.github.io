# Personal Website

This is the repsoitory for my personal website, made to collect my musings and tinkerings as a developer.

It is based on the [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) jekyll template by Sergio Kopplin.

## Setup

To test locally on your machine, do the following steps:

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
2. Clone the repo on your machine
3. Enter the cloned folder via terminal and run `bundle install`
4. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml`
5. Optional, use flags `--host <ipaddress>` for debugging externally and `--future` for publishing future posts
5. Open it in your browser: `http://localhost:4000` or `http://<ipaddress>:4000`
