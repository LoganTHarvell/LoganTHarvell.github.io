## About Me
Hello world, or otherwise nerdy voyeur! My name is Logan Harvell. I created this site be a collection of my musings and tinkerings as a developer.

Before we get into more technical discussion, I would like to talk a bit about myself. I hail from a small city called Orlando located somewhere around the middle of the lovely sunshine state, Florida. So, naturally, I spend many of my days hiding from the sun in front of a screen. I'm a lover of video games, movies, sci-fi/fantasy fiction, anime/manga, and most things from the 90's. Chances are, if you ask me about something relevant to nerd/geek culture, then I will have something to talk to you about and we might have already become friends! However, while I joke about my stints as a cave dweller, as an Eagle Scout, I feel obligated to mention my *other* love of the outdoors. Scandalous! I know! I spent much of my youth going camping, hiking, even scuba diving, and experiencing all the beauty nature has to offer.

Though I dabbled with basic bash scripting on a command line growing up, it wasn't until 2015 that I began a true dive into programming, starting with an introduction to C programming course at the University of Central Florida. Fast forward to December 2018, I graduated from the university with honors and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Somewhere in the middle, I developed a strong foundation for algorithm design and analysis, object-oriented design, C/C++ programming, and 3D math. I also gained experience in a variety of topics including computer architecture, graphics, and vision.

After graduating, I spent over half a year as a research assitant at UCF's Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) under Dr. Joseph Kider. During my time at IST, I collaborated on an Air Force contract by developing plugin tools for Unreal Engine 4. By Fall 2019, I began pursuing a master's degree in Interactive Entertainment at UCF's Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA), a top ranked graduate program for games development. 

At FIEA, I worked on several different small teams to create two week game prototypes, programmed games in from scratch in 68K assembly and C/C++, as well as in Unity and Unreal Engine 4 using C# and C++ respectively. I also developed a custom data-driven game engine from scratch in C++ using JSON as a configuration language. Since December 2019, I've been the lead programmer on Keepers of the Trees at Studio Chili, a studio formed with 20+ artists, desigers, and programmers. [Keepers of the Trees](https://keepersofthetrees.wordpress.com/) is a a local co-op puzzle platformer created in Unreal Engine 4, aiming for release on Steam in August 2020. You can follow the game on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/Keepers_Game).

I anticipate my graduation from FIEA in December 2020. However, starting August 2020 and beyond, I will be pursuing future job opportunities in game development. You can find some of my projects [here]({{ site.url }}/projects/) and my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Resume.pdf). Whether it is about job opportunities or just a chat, please feel free to contact me!
