## About Me
Hello world, or otherwise nerdy voyeur! My name is Logan Harvell. I created this site be a collection of my musings and tinkerings as a developer.

Before we get into more technical discussion, I would like talk a little bit about myself. I hail from a small city called Orlando located somewhere around the middle of the lovely sunshine state, Florida. So, naturally, I spend many of my days hiding from the sun in front of a screen. I'm a lover of video games, movies, sci-fi/fantasy fiction, anime/manga, and most things from the 90's. Chances are, if you ask me about something relevant to nerd/geek culture, then I will have something to talk to you about and we might have already become friends! However, while I joke about my stints as a cave dweller, as an Eagle Scout, I feel obligated to mention my *other* love of the outdoors. Scandalous! I know! I spent much of my youth going camping, hiking, even scuba diving, and experiencing all the beauty nature has to offer.

Though I dabbled with some basic bash scripting in a command line growing up, it wasn't until 2015 that I really began my dive into true programming with an introduction to C programming course at the University of Central Florida. Fast forward to December 2018, I graduated from the university with honors and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Somewhere in the middle, I developed a strong foundation for algorithm design and analysis, object-oriented design, C/C++ programming, and 3D math. I also gained experience in a variety of topics including computer architecture, graphics, and vision.

Two courses in particular that had a huge impact on me were Video Game Theory and Design with professors Peter Telep and Rudy McDaniel and Game Programming with Dr. Tom Carbone (Iron Galaxy Studios, Orlando). The two courses both had connections to UCF's interactive entertainment graduate program, the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA), with Tom Carbone, in fact, one of the founders and the acting director of the programming track at the program. I applied to the program during my senior year, and, on the day of my graduation, I was pleasantly surprised with an acceptance into the Fall 2019 cohort programming track.

From January to August 2019, before officially starting at FIEA, I began a research assitant position at UCF's Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) under Dr. Joseph Kider. During my time at IST, I contributed to an Air Force contract by developing plugin tools for Unreal Engine 4. At FIEA, I worked on several different small teams to create two week game prototypes, programmed games in from scratch in 68K assembly and C/C++, as well as in Unity and Unreal Engine 4 using C# and C++ respectively. I also developed a custom data-driven game engine from scratch in C++ using JSON as a configuration language. Since December 2019, I've been the lead programmer on Keepers of the Trees at Studio Chili, a studio formed with 20+ artists, desigers, and programmers. [Keepers of the Trees](https://keepersofthetrees.wordpress.com/) is a a local co-op puzzle platformer created in Unreal Engine 4, aiming for release on Steam in August 2020. You can follow the game on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/Keepers_Game).

I anticipate my graduation from FIEA with a master's degree in Interactive Entertainment in December 2020. However, starting August 2020 and beyond, I will be pursuing future job opportunities in game development. Whether it is about job opportunities or just a chat, feel free to contact me!
